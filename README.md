This project analyzes the impact of wage reforms on inflation in the Philippines using PSA and World Bank datasets.  
Methods: stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS), Granger causality, ARIMAX/SARIMAX modeling, SHAP feature attribution, and policy scenario simulations (₱200/day wage increase and unified minimum wage).  
Key finding: Wage increases raise household welfare and demand, with inflationary effects delayed 1–3 years and offset when paired with productivity growth.  
Includes Jupyter notebook and presentation deck submitted to the Senate as evidence-based input for policy deliberations.
